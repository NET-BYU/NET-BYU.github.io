                <span class="firstcharacter">I</span>n the NET Lab, we believe in the power of working together to
                change the world. Our research is centered on innovative ways of making a difference in the community
                and improving people's lives. We value all ideas, cultures, and backgrounds and recognize the power that
                comes from diversity. Our research makes a difference.
            </p>

            <p>As a lab, we believe in the following core principles:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="theme purpose">Purpose</span>. In all that we do, there should be a clear purpose and
                    vision.
                    That purpose should
                    be
                    centered around helping people and enriching lives through enhanced technologies.</li>

                <li><span class="theme faith">Faith</span>. We uphold the value of faith in the scientific community and
                    recognize its role in our
                    daily
                    work. Our research is built on the pure pursuit of truth.</li>

                <li><span class="theme collaboration">Collaboration</span>. Problems can rarely be solved in isolation.
                    We recognize the value and richness other fields can bring to our research. We encourage
                    collaboration with others, especially those from different fields.</li>

                <li><span class="theme work-ethic">Work Ethic</span>. We do great work with uncompromising quality. We
                    work on the problems that matter most. From ideation to publication, we uphold the highest standard
                    of quality. We work hard because we know our work matters.</li>
