    We design and build EpiFi, a novel architecture for in-home sensor
    networks which allows epidemiologists to easily design and deploy exposure
    sensing systems in homes.  We work collaboratively with pediatric asthma
    researchers to design multiple studies and deploy EpiFi in homes.  Here,
    we report on experiences from two years of deployments in 15 homes, of two
    different types of studies, including many deployments continuously
    monitored over the past 11 months. Based on lessons learned from these
    deployments and researchers, we develop a new mechanism for sensors to
    bootstrap their connectivity to a subject's home WiFi router and implement
    data reliability mechanisms to minimize loss in the network through a
    long-term deployment.

    When several internet-of-things devices are required to be installed in a
    smart home, significant effort is required to provide each device with the
    association information for the home's wireless router. We design and
    build a novel protocol called Secure Transfer of Association Protocol
    (STRAP), which securely bootstraps connectivity between a set of deployed
    WiFi devices and a home's wireless router. We show that STRAP works in a
    variety of environments and is faster than conventional methods for
    connecting WiFi devices to home wireless routers.
