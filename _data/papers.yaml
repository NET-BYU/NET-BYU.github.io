    We design and build EpiFi, a novel architecture for in-home sensor
    networks which allows epidemiologists to easily design and deploy exposure
    sensing systems in homes.  We work collaboratively with pediatric asthma
    researchers to design multiple studies and deploy EpiFi in homes.  Here,
    we report on experiences from two years of deployments in 15 homes, of two
    different types of studies, including many deployments continuously
    monitored over the past 11 months. Based on lessons learned from these
    deployments and researchers, we develop a new mechanism for sensors to
    bootstrap their connectivity to a subject's home WiFi router and implement
    data reliability mechanisms to minimize loss in the network through a
    long-term deployment.

    Air quality is important, varies across time and space, and is largely
    invisible. Pioneering past work deploying air quality monitors in
    residential environments found that study participants improved their
    awareness of and engagement with air quality. However, these systems
    fielded a single monitor and did not support user-specified annotations,
    inhibiting their utility. We developed MAAV– a system to Measure Air
    quality, Annotate data streams, and Visualize real-time PM2.5 levels – to
    explore how participants engage with an air quality system addressing
    these challenges. MAAV supports collecting data from multiple air quality
    monitors, annotating that data through multiple modalities, and sending
    text message prompts when it detects a PM2.5 spike. MAAV also features an
    interactive tablet interface for displaying measurement data and
    annotations. Through six long-term field deployments (20-47 weeks, mean
    37.7 weeks), participants found these system features important for
    understanding the air quality in and around their homes. Participants
    gained new insights from between-monitor comparisons, reflected on past
    PM2.5 spikes with the help of their annotations, and adapted their system
    usage as they familiarized themselves with their air quality data and
    MAAV. These results yield important insights for designing residential
    sensing systems that integrate into users’ everyday lives.

  abstract: >
    When several internet-of-things devices are required to be installed in a
    smart home, significant effort is required to provide each device with the
    association information for the home's wireless router. We design and
    build a novel protocol called Secure Transfer of Association Protocol
    (STRAP), which securely bootstraps connectivity between a set of deployed
    WiFi devices and a home's wireless router. We show that STRAP works in a
    variety of environments and is faster than conventional methods for
    connecting WiFi devices to home wireless routers.
