- name: Spectrum Sharing via Interference-resilient Passive Receivers and Passive-aware Active Services
  description: |+
    Driven by expanding scientific questions in cosmology and astrophysics and advances in receiver technology, passive radio astronomy observations now take place over the entire radio spectrum. Active wireless services, including 5G cellular networks, are increasing in spectral occupancy from L band to K band and beyond. Cooperative use of radio spectrum would be improved if observatories had more options for RFI mitigation than blanking and excision and digital domain suppression methods. This project will address technological needs at multiple layers of the passive/active spectral user cooperative space, including dynamically tunable notch filters, analog true-time-delay spatial processing for wideband interference nulling at the system front end, and passive-aware active user network protocols that cooperatively reduce interference for passive radio services. These innovative technologies will be integrated into a demonstrator system to provide a comprehensive and multilayered RFI mitigation strategy for existing and future passive and active spectrum users.

    Previous work has been done to retrofit gers so that a electric heater can
    be used instead of a coal heater. To understand and quantify the efficacy of
    the ger retrofit solution, we are deploying 50 air quality sensors inside
    and outside of gers. This will allow us to quantify the impact that the ger
    retrofit has on the air quality within a ger. By placing sensors outside, we
    can also determine how well the retrofit is protecting against particulate
    matter leaking into the structure. Previously collected data has shown that
    the effects of the retrofit are quite dramatic in reducing the amount of
    particulate matter in the air inside the ger. We are deploying more sensors
    for longer time periods to show that this trend is statistically
    significant. This will prove that the retrofit solution is working as
    expected and meets specifications.

  description: |+
    We design and build a protocol called on-off noise power communication
    (ONPC), which modifies the software in commodity packet radios to allow
    communication, independent of their standard protocol, at a very slow rate
    at long range. To achieve this long range, we use the transmitter as an RF
    power source that can be on or off if it does or does not send a packet,
    respectively, and a receiver that repeatedly measures the noise and
    interference power level. We use spread spectrum techniques on top of the
    basic on/off mechanism to overcome the interference caused by other devices'
    channel access to provide long ranges at a much lower data rate. We
    implement the protocol on top of commodity WiFi hardware. We discuss our
    design and how we overcome key challenges such as non-stationary
    interference, carrier sensing and hardware timing delays. We test ONPC in
    several situations to show that it achieves significantly longer range than
    standard WiFi.

    This project is part of a University of Utah informatics center awarded
    through the NIH NIBIB project called Pediatric Research Using Integrated
    Sensor Monitoring Systems (PRISMS). The goal of our project is to develop
    systems for smart and healthly homes, including in-home and personal sensors
    and actuators made to monitor the exposure of residents, to reduce exposures
    to pollutants, and improve health. A key use case is for pediatric asthma
    patients.
